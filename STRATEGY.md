# Strategy, analytics and experiments

Read by the daily production run before every episode; updated by it after every run.

## Goal
Grow @the.impossible.lab (Instagram) and The Impossible Lab (YouTube Shorts) with one reel a day at **16:00 Europe/Bucharest**, improving every day from real statistics.

## KPIs (in priority order)
1. **Hook hold** = 100 − `reels_skip_rate` (Instagram). Target ≥ 70 %.
2. **Watch ratio** = `ig_reels_avg_watch_time` ÷ video length. Target ≥ 60 %.
3. **Sends** (`shares`) and **saves** per 1,000 views: the strongest growth signals.
4. Views (IG + YT) and followers (IG followers + YT subscribers).

Judge a reel at 48 h, not before. Compare against the median of all reels, not against one post.

## Playbook v1 (8 Nov 2026)
- Format: 16.5 s, 1080×1920, Blender scene built from primitives, Kokoro `af_heart` at speed 1.00. Pacing in `pipeline/config.py`, narration rules in `NARRATION.md`.
- Hook: a claim that sounds wrong but is true, spoken and shown on screen at t = 0, with the most striking visual in the first second.
- Three science beats, each with one rounded number and the reason why.
- A twist near the end that people rewatch, then THE REAL SCIENCE card with the precise values.
- On-screen: series tag "THE IMPOSSIBLE LAB · #NN", two-line title, word-by-word captions, one fact chip per beat, footer "@the.impossible.lab".
- Caption: line 1 = the hook; 3–4 short lines of the science; a comment question that asks for an opinion or prediction; a send line naming a person type; "Follow @the.impossible.lab for more impossible science."; the "⚠️ Don't try this." line; ≤ 10 hashtags.
- YouTube title: "What if you …?" style, ≤ 60 characters (the scenario appends " #Shorts").
- No drinking, brands, real people or graphic harm on screen.
- **Disclaimer on every post (Claudio, 8 Nov 2026, mandatory):** the caption carries a line starting "⚠️ Don't try this." with a premise-specific reason (e.g. "Mercury vapour is toxic"), placed just before the hashtags, and THE REAL SCIENCE card shows a one-line "Don't try this. …" in red. The YouTube description is the caption, so it carries the same line. A post without it fails QA.

## Change rule
One adjustment per day at most, logged in the experiment table with its hypothesis. Keep it for at least 3 reels before judging. On Sundays, write a weekly review and, if the evidence supports it, a new playbook version.

## Experiments
| ID | Started | Change | Hypothesis | Status / result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | 9 Nov 2026 | 16.5 s + slower voice (speed 1.00 vs 1.10) | Clearer narration raises watch ratio | running (2 of 3 reels; TIL-02 watch ratio 68 % vs 80 % for TIL-01 at ~25 h, not yet judgeable) |
| E2 | 10 Nov 2026 00:46 (TIL-03) | Caption comment prompt as a one-tap yes/no question ("Would this ship ever make it to port? Yes or no") instead of an open opinion question | A one-tap answer lowers the effort to comment: comments > 0 per 1,000 IG views (0 so far on ~2,000 views) | running |

## Snapshots
| Captured (EET) | Episode | Age | IG views | IG reach | Hook hold | Avg watch s | Shares | Saves | YT views | Followers IG / subs YT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 Nov 18:42 | TIL-01 | 1.5 h | 2 | 0 | n/a | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | n/a / 0 |
| 8 Nov 21:53 | TIL-01 | 4.8 h | 200 | 134 | 72.5 % | 12.2 (81 % of 15 s) | 0 | 0 | 489 (13 likes) | n/a / 1 |

## Findings log
- **9 Nov (run for TIL-03), reels < 48 h old, provisional:**
  1. Instagram distribution is one burst: TIL-02 went 1,771 → 1,774 views between 13:19 and 22:57 EET, TIL-01 has been flat at ~205 since its first evening. The first hours decide reach, so the 16:00 slot matters.
  2. TIL-02 reached 8.4× more accounts than TIL-01 (1,144 vs 136) but held them less (hook hold 67.5 % vs 72.4 %, watch ratio 68 % vs 80 %). E1 is not judgeable yet (n = 2, different reach pools).
  3. Zero shares, saves and comments across ~2,000 IG views: engagement, not reach, is the bottleneck. YouTube delivers similar volume (2,385 views, 1.0–1.3 % likes).
- **Today's adjustment:** E2 (yes/no comment prompt). TIL-03 was published at 00:46 EET on 10 Nov, 8 h 46 min after the 16:00 slot (the run itself started at ~22:56 EET); treat its reach as confounded by the night slot.
